The Global Game Jam 2021 theme was centered around "Lost and Found" with our game project taking this in a more literal sense to everyday objects.
Lost Property is a 2d platformer adopting a 32 bit style with all art assets being created entirely for the project. The game's centralised mechanic would have been a collection system whereupon the defeat of an enemy would grant the player a new item to use, it is then up to the player to decide whether to give up this item to a "Lost Property" box for additional time to the slowly dwindling in-game timer or use the item to clear the level quicker and return more items at once.
